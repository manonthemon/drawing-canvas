## Description

This project was developed to play around with HTML5 "canvas" element which allows for creation of interactive, dynamically updating graphics and animation boars to webpages. Developing this project helped me better understand the following concepts:

<li>HTML5 "canvas"</li>
<li>Array destructuring</li>
<li>Query selectors</li>
<li>If else statements</li>
<li>Functions and arrow functions </li><br>

## Usage

The JSON file could be replaced with an API call to a larger/different locations database.
